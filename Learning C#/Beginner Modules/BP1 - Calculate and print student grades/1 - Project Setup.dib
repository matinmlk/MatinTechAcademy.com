### Project overview
You're developing a Student Grading application that automates the calculation of current grades for each student in a class. The parameters for your application are:

You're given a short list of four students and their five assignment grades.
- Each assignment grade is expressed as an integer value, 0-100, where 100 represents 100% correct.
- Final scores are calculated as an average of the five assignment scores.
- Your application needs to perform basic math operations to calculate the final grades for each student.
- Your application needs to output/display each studentâ€™s name and final score.

Currently, the teachers grade book shows the graded assignments for each student as follows:

```c#
Sophia: 93, 87, 98, 95, 100
Nicolas: 80, 83, 82, 88, 85
Zahirah:   84, 96, 73, 85, 79
Jeong:  90, 92, 98, 100, 97
```

The teacher requires that the calculated grades for each student are displayed as follows:

```c#
Student     Grade
Sophia      94.6  A
Nicolas     83.6  B
Zahirah     83.4  B
Jeong       95.4  A
```

### Setup

1. Open the .NET Editor coding environment.

2. Copy and paste the following code into the .NET Editor. These values represent the graded assignments for each student.

#!csharp

// initialize variables - graded assignments 
int currentAssignments = 5;

int sophia1 = 93;
int sophia2 = 87;
int sophia3 = 98;
int sophia4 = 95;
int sophia5 = 100;

int nicolas1 = 80;
int nicolas2 = 83;
int nicolas3 = 82;
int nicolas4 = 88;
int nicolas5 = 85;

int zahirah1 = 84;
int zahirah2 = 96;
int zahirah3 = 73;
int zahirah4 = 85;
int zahirah5 = 79;

int jeong1 = 90;
int jeong2 = 92;
int jeong3 = 98;
int jeong4 = 100;
int jeong5 = 97;
